    "\n",
    "The $\\mathrm{D}^{+}_{s}$ meson is reconstructed in its hadronic decay channel $\\mathrm{D}^{+}_{s} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{\\phi} + \\pi^+ + K^+ + K^- + \\pi^-$. The $\\mathrm{D}^{+}_{s}$ mesons are typically categorised as either _prompt_ (i.e. originating from charm quark hadronisation) or _non-prompt_ (i.e. originating from beauty-hadron decay). In this tutorial both these classes are considered. In particular, the ML algorithm is going to classify the $\\mathrm{D}^{+}_{s}$ meson candidates as: prompt, non-prompt, or background.\n",

    "Supervised learning, a well-established subfield within the realm of Machine Learning, holds significant relevance in High Energy Physics (HEP). In this context, supervised learning techniques are instrumental to solve classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with a training set, comprising a set of examples. Each element of this training set is assigned a label indicating its class. In the physics case under study: prompt, non-prompt, or background. In the training the class information is known in advance. The training process focuses on optimising the internal parameters of the ML algorithm to maximise the separation power between the classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the training is to impart the model with common data patterns that can be exploited for accurately classify an independent sample, the data collected by ALICE for instance. The supervised model associates to each candidate an _outputscore_, which depends on the properties of the candidate itself, referred to as _features_. The score is linked to the probability of the candidate belonging to one of the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, _Boosted Decision Trees_ (BDTs) are employed to tag prompt and non-prompt $\\mathrm{D}^{+}_{s}$ candidates. The building block of every BDT model is the _Decision Tree_ algorithm (DT). A decision tree is a binary structure that resembles a flowchart. In this structure, internal nodes represent features or candidates, branches indicate decision rules, and leaf nodes represent the final outcomes. The DT operates by employing a sequence of simple binary tests, each corresponding to a branch in the tree, to classify a data point based on its features. These tests involve applying a linear threshold to one of the features, aiding the model in predicting the class to which every candidate belongs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training a decision tree involves an automated process that recursively constructs the tree using the training set. However, a key limitation of decision trees is their susceptibility to _overfitting_. This means that, if a decision tree is deep enough (where depth is defined as the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf), it can perfectly classify the training set but may struggle to generalise to new data. Overfitting occurs when the model essentially \"memorises\" the training set rather than learning more general patterns in data. To mitigate this issue, BDT algorithms are employed, which combine multiple shallow trees, each using a subset of features. In the boosting procedure, decision trees are constructed sequentially, with an emphasis on compensating for misclassified candidates from the previous trees. The resulting model, the BDT, maintains strong performance on both the training and test sets."
