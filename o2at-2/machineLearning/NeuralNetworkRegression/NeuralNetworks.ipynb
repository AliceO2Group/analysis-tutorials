    "Neural networks are powerful regression tools that have gained tremendous popularity in the recent years. While it is typically presented that ML can be divided into classification and regression, it is only part of the magic that goes on behind the curtain. Externally, a neural network can be thought of as a funcion that maps from an input space of basically arbitrary dimensions to an output space. While input and output are clearly defined by the user, the internal workings of neural networks can only be understood in rare cases (basically only when the network is structured in a certain way, e.g. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)). Understanding the internal parameters (weights and biases) of a neural network is like trying to track an N-particle simulation: You won't succeed just doing it by hand. You need algorithms!<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The full neural network is complex and inter-linked, however it's constituents are not! A single neuron is typically just a simple function (ReLU, Tanh, or logisitc sigmoid) that takes the input from the previous layer (X), multiplies it with an internal weight matrix (W), adds a bias term (B) evaluates the function and passes it on to the next layer.\n",

This means that the network loops many times over your dataset until you are satisfied with its performance, typically measured by the loss score. However what might happen is that the full dataset covers a vast area of your phase-space and hence calculating the gradient once for the full dataset might not be very representative and might not help the network to learn well. For this, it is highly recommended to divide your training data into <font color='orange'>(mini-)batches</font>. This means that per epoch the network still loops once over the full data but the weights are updated $n$ times if you divide your training dataset into $n$ (equally sized) batches.

    "The following application was made for the TPC PID calibration in Run 3 of ALICE. It is meant to replace the spline approach which was used during Run 1 and 2. Due to its inherent capapbilities of fitting multidimensional functions, the neural network approach can learn cross-variable correlations and can optimize N$\\sigma$ distribuitions multidimensionally. Since a theoretic approximation of the specific energy loss per unit distance in the TPC gas volume is known (Bethe-Bloch function using the truncated mean estimation for the dE/dx signal), a ratio to the Bethe-Bloch curve can be made. This takes out a significant amount of correlation in momentum vs. dE/dx such that the final neural network only has to correct the ratio from few percent to the permille-level. The goal was a precision of $\\leq 5 {}^\\text{o}\\mkern-5mu/\\mkern-3mu_\\text{oo}$ and better than $0.1\\sigma$.<br>\n",
